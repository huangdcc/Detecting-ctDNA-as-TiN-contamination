# Detecting-ctDNA-as-TiN-contamination

**Project Aim**
To detect evidence of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood/normal sample collected from a group of prostate cancer patients: DNA are released into the bloodstream from normal or tumour cells upon cell death. Based on this premise, we expect the circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood of patients will contain detectable trace of tumour-derived DNA. To verify this hypothesis, we will look for indications of tumour contamination in blood using a combination of evidence and techniques.

**R analysis**
Each R code file contains analysis for a single patient with ID 'PPCG----'
